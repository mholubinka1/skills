# Review Criteria (repo-specific)

Review criteria this repository has accumulated from its own Copilot review rounds.

- The `address-copilot-comments` skill appends a generalised, one-line criterion here for
  every Copilot finding on a PR that resulted in a code change. Findings that were pushed
  back on ("Ignored.") are never recorded — this file only holds criteria the team accepted
  by changing code.
- The `code-review` skill feeds this file to its Standards sub-agent alongside the skill's
  own `REVIEW-CRITERIA.md`, and treats the entries here as documented repo standards (a
  breach may be blocking).
- Prune stale entries, and promote durable ones into a shared criteria file, by hand.

Each entry is a bold label plus a one-line imperative rule, tagged with the PR it came
from — for example:
`- **Partial checks for compound state**: flag a readiness check that inspects one artefact when the state it gates has several parts. (PR #58)`

## Criteria

- **Incomplete cross-reference**: when a change adds a fresh statement of a fact that is
  defined canonically elsewhere (a rule, a constraint, an enumeration), it must carry the
  same qualifiers as the canonical version — a summary that silently drops a caveat reads as
  a contradiction between the two places. (PR #64)
